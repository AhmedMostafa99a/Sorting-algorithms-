# 🧮 Sorting System in C++

Welcome to **Deadline Fighters' Sorting System** 🎉  
This project implements multiple sorting algorithms in C++ with a menu-driven interface and performance measurement.  
It also includes a custom **`my_vector`** class (similar to `std::vector`) for dynamic array handling.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Works with different data types:  
  - `int`  
  - `double`  
  - `string`  
  - `char`  

- ⚡ Implements **9 sorting algorithms**:
  1. Insertion Sort  
  2. Selection Sort  
  3. Bubble Sort  
  4. Shell Sort  
  5. Merge Sort  
  6. Quick Sort  
  7. Count Sort (for `int`)  
  8. Radix Sort (for `int`)  
  9. Bucket Sort  

- ⏱️ **Performance Measurement**: Calculates execution time for each algorithm using `chrono`.

- 📊 Step-by-step iteration display for better understanding.
